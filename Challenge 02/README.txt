This is the folder for my solution to challenge 2 of IGN's CodeFoo Internship Application.

Question Answer: Approximately anywhere between 14,433,523,810 - 101,034,666,667 (it depends on what size logs you use)

Assuming that the replica is hollow I found my dividing the volume of the Empire State Building by th volume of the smallest size Licoln Log which scales evenly into the larger sized ones.

As i couldnt find the exact dimensions of standard lincoln logs I referenced the dimensions from a do it yourself article (https://makesomething.tv/how-make-lincoln-logs) that seemed to be close the geniune product.

Using the measurements from this article I was able to calculate the approximate volume of a Licoln Log to be .6328125 cubic inches or 0.0003662109375 cubic feet. Using Google I also know the approximate volume of the Empire State building to 37,000,000 cubic feet. From here it just simple division, leading me to the answer of approximately 101,034,666,667 Licoln Logs

Though this answer was arrivied at using the smallest sized Licoln Log and as suchs would most likely be the maximum amount of logs that you would ever need to use. The largest size Licoln Log is 7 times the size of the smallest, so applying the same math it would take 14,433,523,810 Licoln Logs to build a replica of the empire state building if I was purely using 10.5 in Lincoln Logs.
